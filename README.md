# Flood Myth
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

Here's my version of Conway's Game of Life based on The Genesis flood.
# Description
Light-green cells: earth before flood.

Blue cells: water/flood.

Brown cells: Noah's ark.

White cell: God whatching what he did and then leaving.

Pink and dark-green cells: mythical/legendary creatures.
